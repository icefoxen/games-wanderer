TODO:
DO AN EXAMPLE OF JUST TEXTURING A QUAD, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

Go over the whole fucking engine, and see what's good and what isn't.
Fix camera zoom!
Real lighting and skybox classes!
Real skybox class with multiple textures!
Timers (objects that are updated and count down in ms, then activate some
function or such.  A manager class to update them all.  Maybe ones that loop.
Useful for particles.)
Timed input (as in, input not based on frame count)
Draw textured meshes, and materials
Collision detection/raycasting
